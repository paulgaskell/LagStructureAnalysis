# Lag Structure Analysis Methods 

Collection of interesting algos for lag structure analysis includes; 

### SDM

Algo introduced in Gaskell, McGroarty, and Tiropanis 2015
https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/for.2365

Finds a distribution over the lagged values of one or more time-series 
that provides the Bayesian optimal forecast of a leading series. 

### TOP

Introduced in Sornette and Zhou 2005
https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14697680500383763

Aligns 2 time-series by finding the lowest average energy path over a 
random energy landscape formed by the distances between the two series.
